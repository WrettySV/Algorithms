Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.
Dequeue. A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure.
Corner cases. Throw the specified exception for the following corner cases:

Throw a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if the client calls either addFirst() or addLast() with a null argument.
Throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException if the client calls either removeFirst() or removeLast when the deque is empty.
Throw a java.util.NoSuchElementException if the client calls the next() method in the iterator when there are no more items to return.
Throw a java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException if the client calls remove()the method in the iterator.
Unit testing. Your main() method must call directly every public constructor and method to help verify that they work as prescribed (e.g., by printing results to standard output).

Performance requirements. Your deque implementation must support each deque operation (including construction) in constant worst-case time. A deque containing n items must use at most 48n + 192 bytes of memory. Additionally, your iterator implementation must support each operation (including construction) in constant worst-case time.
